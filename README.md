**jsbin** is a groundbreaking compiler project that translates JavaScript code directly into native executable files capable of running independently on **macOS, Linux, and Windows**. With no need for Node.js or any external runtime, it truly delivers on the promise of "Write in JavaScript, Run as Native."

**✨ Core Features**

*   **True Native Binaries**: Outputs standard ELF, Mach-O, or PE format files, identical to native system applications.
*   **Zero External Dependencies**: Compiled programs do not rely on Node.js, a browser, or any external JavaScript engine.
*   **Cross-Platform Support**: Compile a single codebase into executables for all three major desktop operating systems.
*   **Low-Level Compilation**: Generates highly efficient assembly code directly, rather than merely bundling or packaging existing code.
